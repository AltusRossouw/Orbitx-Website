# Client Logo Size Consistency Improvements

## Changes Made:

### 1. Updated Image Dimensions
- **Before**: `width={120}` `height={80}`
- **After**: `width={140}` `height={60}` (wider aspect ratio to better accommodate typical logo formats)

### 2. Enhanced CSS Styling
- **Before**: `max-w-full max-h-full object-contain`
- **After**: `w-full h-full object-contain object-center` with inline style constraints

### 3. Added Size Constraints
Added inline styles to ensure more consistent visual sizing:
```css
style={{
  maxWidth: '140px',
  maxHeight: '60px',
  minWidth: '80px',
  minHeight: '40px'
}}
```

## Benefits:

✅ **More Uniform Appearance**: All logos now have more consistent visual weight
✅ **Better Alignment**: `object-center` ensures logos are centered within their containers
✅ **Responsive Scaling**: Logos scale appropriately across different screen sizes
✅ **Maintained Aspect Ratios**: `object-contain` preserves logo proportions
✅ **Size Boundaries**: Min/max constraints prevent logos from being too small or too large

## Visual Impact:

- Logos will appear more balanced in the grid layout
- Better visual hierarchy and professional appearance
- Improved consistency while respecting brand guidelines
- Enhanced responsive behavior across devices

The changes maintain the existing hover effects and animation while creating a more polished, professional look for the client showcase section.
