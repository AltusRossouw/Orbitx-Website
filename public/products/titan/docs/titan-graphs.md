## 1. Light Survival Rate Curve

This graph shows the percentage of lights still operational over time.

**X-Axis:** Time (in thousands of hours)
**Y-Axis:** Light Survival (%)

| Time (k hours) | Approx. Survival Rate (%) |
| :------------- | :------------------------ |
| 0              | 100%                      |
| 10             | ~100%                     |
| 20             | ~100%                     |
| 30             | ~99%                      |
| 40             | ~97%                      |
| 50             | ~92%                      |
| 60             | ~85%                      |
| 70             | ~75%                      |
| 80             | ~62%                      |
| 90             | ~48%                      |
| 100            | ~32%                      |

**Conclusion:** The graph shows a very high survival rate for the first 40,000 hours, with a gradual decline afterwards, supporting the 60,000-hour L70 nominal lifetime claim.

## 2. Rate of Reduction in Light Output (Lumen Maintenance)

This graph (L70 curve) shows the decrease in lumen output over time. The L70 point indicates the time it takes for the light output to depreciate to 70% of its initial value.

**X-Axis:** Time (in thousands of hours)
**Y-Axis:** Lumen Output (%)

| Time (k hours) | Approx. Lumen Output (%) |
| :------------- | :----------------------- |
| 0              | 100%                     |
| 10             | ~98%                     |
| 20             | ~96%                     |
| 30             | ~94%                     |
| 40             | ~91%                     |
| 50             | ~87%                     |
| 60             | ~82%                     |
| **~64**        | **70% (L70 Point)**      |
| 70             | ~65%                     |
| 80             | ~55%                     |
| 90             | ~45%                     |
| 100            | ~35%                     |

**Conclusion:** The product meets its L70 rating, with lumen output maintained above 70% for approximately 64,000 hours.

## 3. Light Quality Classification (CRI vs. GAI)

This scatter plot compares the Colour Rendering Index (CRI) and Gamut Area Index (GAI) to define "Type A" lighting quality as per the Lighting Research Centre, New York.

*   The chart has two axes:
    *   **X-Axis:** Colour Rendering Index (CRI) from 0 to 100.
    *   **Y-Axis:** Gamut Area Index (GAI) from 0 to 100.
*   A zone in the upper-right quadrant is shaded and labeled "**Type A Lighting**".
*   A single data point is plotted for the OrbitX Titan product.

**OrbitX Titan Data Point:**
*   **CRI:** 83
*   **GAI:** 96

**Conclusion:** The Titan's plotted point (83, 96) falls well within the defined "Type A Lighting" zone, confirming its high-quality light output for visual applications.

## 4. Spectral Power Distribution (SPD)

This graph shows the relative power (P) distribution across the visible light spectrum (wavelength in nanometers).

**X-Axis:** Wavelength (nm)
**Y-Axis:** Relative Power (P)

**Key Peaks:** The graph shows a modern LED spectrum with significant peaks in the blue and green-yellow regions, typical for a 5000K CCT LED.
*   A major peak is present in the **~485 nm** (blue) range.
*   A broad, dominant peak is centered around **~610 nm** (green-yellow/orange).
*   A smaller, trailing peak extends into the **~735 nm** (far red) range.

**Comparison:** The curve is labeled "T8", indicating this is the spectral output for the Titan product, likely contrasting it with the flatter, less efficient spectrum of traditional fluorescent T8 tubes.

**Conclusion:** The SPD graph confirms the LED technology and the 5000K cool white color temperature, explaining the high efficacy (135 lm/W) and the specific CRI/GAI values.
